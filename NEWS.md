# litxr 0.0.3

- Added `litxr_add_dois()` for DOI-batch ingestion across journals, with
  automatic Crossref journal registration into `config.yaml` when needed.
- Extended `litxr_export_bib()` to export by record keys such as DOI, `ref_id`,
  or `source_id`, with warnings for missing keys.
- Made config loading tolerant of tab-indented YAML files.
- Added `scripts/repair_arxiv_range.R` for day-by-day arXiv repair with
  per-day pagination and sleep intervals.
- Updated the arXiv repair scripts to load the local repo code when run via
  `Rscript`, avoiding stale installed-package behavior.

# litxr 0.0.2

- Added explicit journal upsert behavior with conflict logging for unusual
  metadata replacements.
- Added `fst`-backed journal indexes and `litxr_rebuild_journal_index()` for
  faster local reads.
- Improved Crossref and arXiv parsing robustness across payload shape
  variations.
- Added arXiv request pacing, retry handling, and `litxr_repair_journal()` for
  bounded repair and backfill runs.
- Added `scripts/repair_arxiv.R` as a small CLI wrapper for shell-driven arXiv
  repair jobs.
- Clarified local storage layout, including future `pdf/`, `md/`, and `llm/`
  directions.

# litxr 0.0.1

- Added journal-centric local storage and BibTeX export helpers.
